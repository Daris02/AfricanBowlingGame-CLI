# African bowling game on the command line
This project consists of a Java implementation of an African game on the command line. The rules of this game are similar to those of bowling, but with a few specific nuances.

### Game Rules
- Players throw a piece of wood at 15 pins and try to knock down as many as possible.
- The game consists of 5 frames for each player.
- Each frame consists of 3 throws.
- After each frame, the pins are straightened.
- If all the pins are knocked down with the first throw of a frame, it's a strike.
- If all the pins are knocked down after the 2nd or 3rd throw, it's a spare.
- A spare counts 15 plus the pins of the next 2 throws, i.e. a maximum of 45 if the next two throws are strikes.
- A strike counts 15 plus the pins of the next 3 deliveries, i.e. a maximum of 60 if the next 2 deliveries are strikes.
- In the event of a strike or a spare in the last frame, the player may make additional throws to calculate the points for the last frame.
- The maximum perfect score is 300.
